Stopwatch for calibration of *Infusomat Space* Ð¸ *Infusomat fm*S infusion pumps manufactured by **B|Braun Melsungen AG** Used by **B|Braun** service engineers during the repair and maintenance of the above equipment.

Helps to greatly facilitate the calibration of infusion pumps. It is convenient to time and reset the countdown to zero after the previous procedure. No need to constantly monitor the filling of the flask: the program will beep when you need to get ready to stop the pump. There is no need to manually recalculate the speed deviation and the necessary correction: everything happens automatically when you press the corresponding button.

Instructions for use:

1. Prepare the device for calibration according to the service manual
2. Run the program
3. Simultaneously start the pump and press ***Start/Stop***
4. Once the calibration flask is full, stop the program with the Stop button and the pump
5. Click Calculate to calculate the deviation and Scale Factor
6. For convenience, to prevent overfilling of the flask, shortly before the end of its filling (and also at the time of 6:00), warning sound signals are given. The colored bar at the bottom of the window after pressing the Calculate button indicates the need to change the pump settings:

* Red color : correction required
* Yellow: correction can be made but not required
* Green color : no correction required
